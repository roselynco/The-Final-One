# The-Final-One

Dear Future CS Students…
Hey, my name is Roselyn. If you're just starting your CS journey—welcome and buckle up! These past three years have been a wild ride filled with stress, laughter, and lessons I’ll carry for the rest of my life. I’ll just repeat it again in case you didn’t catch it... it will be a wild ride filled with a ton of STRESS! Here's a little something to help you survive and thrive through it.

# What Do You Wish You Knew When You Started?
I wish I knew that you don’t need to be a coding genius to succeed. You are here to learn! CS isn’t about being perfect, it's about trying whenever you fail. It’s about looking for as many solutions as possible. Trust me, it's okay not to understand everything right away. I went into AP with NO experience in the field, and here I am-with great grades and thriving through it all. I used to feel behind just because others “got it” faster, but I learned that everyone struggles at some point.

# What Was the Most Surprising Thing About CS?
Honestly? How much I would actually love it—even while crying through AP 😂. I love that this class isn’t limited to just your thoughts, but that others are able to join, help, and comment on your project. I love that you aren’t restricted from using AI because, at the end of the day, this is what’s being used out there in the real field. Just don’t overdo it, please—learn something. I thought CS was just going to be typing code and memorizing syntax, but it’s so much more than that. It’s about solving problems, building cool things, and learning how to think differently. Also... I didn’t expect to talk about college every single day in class. But somehow, those convos became some of my favorite memories.


# What Mindset Helped You Succeed?
These past 3 years have honestly been the best part of my high school experience—even though I cried almost EVERY SINGLE DAY in AP. I’m forever grateful I had Ms. Portocarrero as my teacher. I won’t be able to talk highly enough about her here, but she knows she means the world to me, and I will FOREVER have her in my heart.

## What helped me most was realizing that:
Patience is key!!

It’s okay to try and fail.

Self-doubt is normal, but you don’t have to listen to it (I’m still learning this).

You can always ask for help!

Taking one small step is better than trying to take three and falling.

## ❤️ Favorite CS Memory
One of my favorite memories was how close we all got as a class—especially during AP CS. We'd joke around, stress about college together, and mostly stress about the class itself together (trying to act like everything was okay when I still hadn't done my project due the next day). This classroom has been way more than just a classroom to me. I swear, it has been like a second home to me. I can't pick just ONE SINGLE moment.

Beth has been so special to all of us—to me—she has been the best and one of the most comforting teachers I've ever had. I want all of you to know that she gives it her ALL to give us what we deserve, and that she fights for a lot more than y’all think for us. She loves what she does and it shows. I love you so much, Beth!
