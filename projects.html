  <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h3> Lightbulb Logic Puzzle 💡</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> A logic-based puzzle where you have to figure out the correct order to light up the bulbs.</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Replit</p>
  <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned the importance of commenting my code! I used to jump straight into coding without leaving comments because I thought I’d remember everything. But I’d always forget and end up stuck on small problems for hours. With this project, I realized that comments save you time, help organize your thoughts, and make your future self’s life easier. This project taught me that frustration is part of the process and that writing clean, thoughtful code REALLY matters.</p>

  <h3> Travel Planner ✈️ </h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> A travel website to help plan your next adventure, complete with locations, experiences, and a mock sign-up.</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Replit</p>
  <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> I’m honestly the most proud of this project. I remember doubting myself so much while working with Yulenny, since she’s so good at coding. I was scared I’d mess it all up. But learning together was such a great experience. I had to ask my friends for help a *lot*, and I’ll never forget that FaceTime call where Lenny was SO patient with me trying to fix the sign-up button. She ended up solving it, but I learned so much. Compare to what I can do now these webistes are wack, but it reminds me how far I’ve come and thats why im so proud of it.</p>

<div class="project">
  <h3> Emoji Interaction 😊</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> A creative visual piece where hovering over emojis reveals changing patterns—simple but expressive.</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> p5.js (JavaScript Library)</p>
  <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> These early projects might seem basic compared to what I can do now, but this was my second mastery check ever, and I was SO proud of it. I finally figured out how to use `ellipse()` and how `mouseX` and `mouseY` could change what’s on the screen. It took me forever to get it right, but once I did, I was so proud. This project reminds me how far I’ve come—from just learning the tools to now building full websites.</p>
