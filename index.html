  <h1> Hey, I'm Roselyn!</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I’m Roselyn. I love traveling, going to the beach, listening to music, and vibing at concerts 🎶🌊✈️. I’ve spent the last few years diving into Computer Science—learning to code, solve problems, and express myself through tech. I plan to study Computer Information Systems and/or Business after high school and hope to one day work in a field where I can blend creativity, technology, and business. I hope to work in project management, product design, or analytics. But most importantly, I definitely plan on traveling the world while I’m at it 🌍✈️.
    I complain a lot about CS but I’ve learned that growth comes from showing up. These past three years in Computer Science have shaped me in ways I never expected.
  </p>

  <h2> Why I Chose CS </h2>
  <p>
    I joined CS because my friend was going into it. I said, why not? Not knowing the journey I was entering. That summer was something else... But here I am, having built websites and solved challenges. It taught me patience, confidence, and how to trust my process.
